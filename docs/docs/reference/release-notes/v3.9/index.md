## React 18 - New Suspense SSR Architecture

We're happy to announce support for the new React 18 server architecture during built time. When installing `react@alpha` and `react-dom@alpha`, you automatically opt into the new [`pipeToNodeWritable`](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37) renderer. Now you're able to use `Suspense` and `React.lazy` on the server as well.
